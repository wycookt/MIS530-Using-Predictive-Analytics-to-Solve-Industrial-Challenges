# MIS530-Using-Predictive-Analytics-to-Solve-Industrial-Challenges

Pick an industry (e.g., airlines, insurance, banking) and identify a data problem that can be solved using advanced predictive analytics. For the problem you identified, describe all the CRISP-DM phases that will be followed, from the setting up, defining, and identification phases thru the deployment phase.

Your final project should, at the minimum, contain the following:

Introduction to the industry domain
Definition of the data problem
Solution using the predictive analytics
Data CRISP-DM life cycle phases
Logical architecture diagram as applicable
Answers to the following: How would the SAS Enterprise minerâ€™s predictive analytical functions explored in this course be used (where applicable) to help you with the analysis? If it is not SAS Enterprise Miner, what other tool would you recommend? Why?
